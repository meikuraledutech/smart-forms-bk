FLOW INTEGRATION
Forms connect to dynamic question flows.

Flow Endpoints:
- PATCH /forms/:form_id/flow - Create/update flow
- GET /forms/:form_id/flow - Get flow structure

See flows.txt for complete flow documentation.

RULES
- Forms are user-owned
- Deleted forms are excluded from all queries
- Only PATCH, POST, GET (no PUT/DELETE)
- List ordered by updated_at DESC
- Each form can have one flow (1:1 relationship)

MIGRATIONS
- Raw SQL only
- Files:
  migrations/002_create_forms.up.sql
  migrations/002_create_forms.down.sql

IMPLEMENTED INTEGRATIONS
- Flow module (dynamic question trees)
- Questions module (auto-created from flows)

FUTURE EXTENSIONS (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Form responses/submissions
- Sharing/public forms
- Role-based access
- Analytics dashboard
- Form templates
- Duplicate forms
